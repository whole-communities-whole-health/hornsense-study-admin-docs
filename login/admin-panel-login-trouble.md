## Admin user login issues
Existing study admins may encounter issues logging into the admin panel. The following steps will resolve the
situation:

1. You should not share a password or account with anyone. If you are sharing your account with other people, verify that the password hasn't been changed.

2. Clear your browser cache and cookies. 

3. Verify the issue exists on another browser.

4. There is a prod and dev admin panel for each study. Verify you are logging into the correct one. The easiest way to tell which you are logging into is to look at the url at the top of the login page. Also verify that you are using the correct MFA token for the admin panel you're logging into.

5. If you have a new phone, verify you've installed your MFA app correctly.

6. If you forgot your password, you will need to have another study admin set up a new account for you. There is not a way to reset a forgotten password.
